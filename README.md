# Project-Forest-Hydrology-Calculus
Final project for the SoftUni **"Math Concepts for Developers"** course. It uses Calculus and Python to analyze river hydrographs, evaluating how forest cover impacts runoff dynamics.

<ins>Project Description:</ins> This project demonstrates the application of calculus in forestry and environmental engineering by analyzing river hydrographs. Using Python, I simulate how different forest density levels influence the shape of the runoff curve.
The model does not claim to be exhaustive, but rather a mathematical computational example for representing the dependence between individual components of the natural and surrounding environment, such as forests and water. The model aims to show the predictability of events with the help of mathematics, which can support better planning and management of processes.

Key Mathematical Goals:
1.	Differentiation: Identify the Local Extrema (Peak Discharge) and analyze the rate of change during storm events.
2.	Integration: Calculate the Definite Integral of the discharge function to determine the total water volume moved through the system.
3.	Curvature Analysis: Use the second derivative to evaluate the Convexity/Concavity of the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph, reflecting soil saturation levels.
